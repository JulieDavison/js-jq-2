Write a script that prints the numbers 1 to 100 in the console. But for multiples of three, print `Fizz` instead of the number. For multiples of five, print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print `FizzBuzz`.

<!-- write a function -->
<script>
    
    for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
      if (i%3 === 0){
          console.log(fizz);

      }else if (i%5 ===0)
    
      both 3 an 5  goes to the top


    }

    console.log(i);
    </script>

<!-- For loop to go through all the numbers using i++ to get numbers 1 to 100-->

<!-- variable % 3 === 0  print Fizz -->
<!-- variable % 5 === 0 print BUzz-->
